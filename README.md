# UCR-CS166-Final-Project
This was my final project for my database class at UCR. The project had us implement the functions for this Java based interactive console for non-sql users. The theme of the database was an online hotel management system that would have regular users and admin users. Database queries would be handled by PostgreSQL.

There are bugs within this program but the functions do work as intended.

This project had to be ran remotely through my university's SSH to properly load the PostgreSQL scripts/files.
